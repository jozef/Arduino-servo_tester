NAME

    servo_tester.ino - control servo motor via serial console

SYNOPSIS

    after flashing into Arduino, connect via serial console 9600 to send
    commands:

        servo signal pin is 9
        supported commands:
            s [int]              - turn servo to 0-180
            us [int]             - set puls width 544-? (2400)
            sweep [int] [int]    - sweep 0-180-0, optional step delay and count
            ?                    - print this help
        s 90
        new pos: 90
        us 1400
        new us: 1400

DESCRIPTION

    Serial console accepts commands and sets servo motor accordingly. Servo
    control pin is hard-coded to pin 9.

COMMANDS

 s [int]

    Set servo angle. Value range 0 to 180.

 us [int]

    Set servo angle using PWM peak time length in nano seconds. Value range
    564 to 1496.

sweep [int] [int]

    Moves servo from 90 to 180, then back to 0 and again to 90 degree.

    Both parameters are optional. First sets the time in milliseconds to
    wait between each angle change, default 15. The second is the number of
    repeats, default 1.

TODO

    In the future, if time and motivation persists, the code may evolve
    into full multi-servo test/control module.
